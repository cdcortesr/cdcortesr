# 📁 Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub project portfolio.

This repository serves as a curated collection of projects I have worked on, presented as part of my professional CV. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills, experience, and previous work to potential employers, collaborators, and other interested parties.

Each project included here highlights different aspects of my expertise and reflects my commitment to quality, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
